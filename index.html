      <h3>What the #$@! is the Museum Swear Jar?</h3>
            <p>The Museum Swear Jar was born out of the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=%23museumworkersspeak&src=typd">#MuseumWorkersSpeak</a> chat. It started with an expression of frustration at the use of the phrase "This is the way we've always done things." A passing tweet asking for other phrases that would feed the Museum Swear Jar began pouring in (we really should invest in some counselling, folks), and thus, a movement was born. The Museum Swear Jar has an enduring Twitter presence. But it has also recently become manifest in real life, making its first appearance at Museum Computer Network 2015. It will likely be appearing at a museum conference, #DrinkingAboutMuseums or frustrated  colleague's desk near you!</p>
      <h3>Who the #$@! is the Museum Swear Jar?</h3>
        <p>We are all the Museum Swear Jar. The Museum Swear jar is us. But really, <a href="traceybergfulton.com">Tracey Berg-Fulton</a> and <a href="www.twitter.com/caw_">Chad Weinard</a> tend and feed the Jar.</p>
